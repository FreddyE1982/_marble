## Neuroplasticity Training Parameters

- aggressive_starting_neuroplasticity (bool, default: false)
  Enables an initial phase where a minimum number of neurons is added at each training step.
- add_min_new_neurons_per_step (int)
  Required when aggressive_starting_neuroplasticity is true. Minimum neurons to grow per step during the aggressive phase.
- aggressive_phase_steps (int)
  Required when aggressive_starting_neuroplasticity is true. Number of steps to keep aggressive growth before reverting to normal behaviour.

## Resource Allocator Settings

- resource_allocator.max_disk_mb (int, default: 20480)
  Limits total size in MB of tensors offloaded to disk by the resource allocator.
  Must be positive. When exceeded, tensors are cleared instead of offloaded.
- resource_allocator.compress_offload (bool, default: true)
  When true, tensors moved to CPU or disk are converted to ``float16`` to save
  space. They are restored to their original dtype when reloaded.
- resource_allocator.min_gpu_tensor_mb (float, default: 1.0)
  Minimum tensor size in megabytes required before the allocator considers
  moving it to GPU. Smaller tensors stay on CPU to avoid transfer overhead.
