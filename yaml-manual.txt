## Neuroplasticity Training Parameters

- aggressive_starting_neuroplasticity (bool, default: false)
  Enables an initial phase where a minimum number of neurons is added at each training step.
- add_min_new_neurons_per_step (int)
  Required when aggressive_starting_neuroplasticity is true. Minimum neurons to grow per step during the aggressive phase.
- aggressive_phase_steps (int)
  Required when aggressive_starting_neuroplasticity is true. Number of steps to keep aggressive growth before reverting to normal behaviour.

## Resource Allocator Settings

- resource_allocator.max_disk_mb (int, default: 20480)
