- Added optional CPU pre-forward pass for `Wanderer` via `pre_forward=True`,
  recording CPU compute and GPU transfer times to help tune VRAM usage.

- Compress repeating byte sequences in `UniversalTensorCodec` via on-the-fly
  dictionary to reduce token counts and VRAM usage.
- Track per-neuron loss differences with rolling history and mean value.
- Add support for `train_type` kwarg to `marble.training.run_training_with_datapairs` to match `marble.marblemain` API.
- Wire Brain-train plugin lifecycle (`on_init`/`on_end`) and merge returned summaries.
- Apply learning paradigms to the Wanderer in the lock-based datapair helper for consistent behavior.

- Keep tqdm progress lines visible when training via `run_training_with_datapairs`:
  - Added `Wanderer.pbar_leave` public attribute (default False).
- The datapair and wanderer-training helpers set `w.pbar_leave = True` so the status line isnâ€™t suppressed.
 - Added `Wanderer.pbar_verbose` to emit explicit per-walk start/end messages; helpers now leave it disabled so progress remains on a single line.
 - Progress reporting uses `tqdm.auto` for robust notebook and terminal updates.
